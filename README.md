# Disease-prediction-using-machine-learning
Developed a robust disease prediction using machine learning techniques, specifically using the decision tree, random forest, naive bayes algorithm.
Preprocessed data extensively, including cleaning and feature engineering, to ensure suitability for modeling.

 Implemented within the python language, enabling an interactive and user- friendly interface for data input and visualization.
